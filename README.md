# Compromising-Active-Directory-TryHackMe-Module
While Learning how to exploit Windows Active Directory networks through core security issues stemming from misconfigurations, I have been taking the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) module: [Compromising Active Directory](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-active-directory). This Repository servers the purpose of Logging my progress in the six practice Rooms.

## ðŸ”¥Introduction
### Module Overview
The module, [Compromising Active Directory](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-active-directory) is aimed to help one learn and exploit Active Directory networks through core security issues stemming from misconfigurations.

The six rooms in the module also gives a hands on practice enviroment to learn the basics of AD and take one on the typical journey of compromising AD during a red team. The red team engagements include breaching AD, enumerating AD, exploiting AD, and finally deploying persistence through AD.

**Rooms:**
- Active Directory Basics
- Breaching Active Directory
- Lateral Movement and Pivoting
- Exploiting Active Directory
- Persisting Active Directory
- Credential Harvesting


### AD Overview
For an enterprise with a number of users and computers in its network, it would be quite difficult to manage each computer as a separate entity, manually configure policies for each of the users across the network and provide on-site support for everyone. To overcome these limitations, enterprises use a Windows domain.

A **Windows Domain** is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business/enterprise. It is a logical grouping of computers, users, and resources (like printers and servers) that share a common database and security policies. Its main purpose is to provide a centralized management of users and resources.

For instance, ***company.local*** could be a domain that includes all employee accounts, office PCs, and shared printers.

The core of any Windows Domain is theÂ **Active Directory(AD) Domain Service,** or rather, we can say that the AD DS is the engine that powers Windows domains. It is a Directory Service developed by Microsoft that organises information about â€˜objectsâ€™ (users, groups, computers, etc ) in a network. I.e, the AD keeps the catalogue/database of all users in ***company.local***, their passwords, group memberships and permissions.

So simply put, the **Active Directory (AD)** is a single repository that centralises the administration of common components of a Windows computer network, with the **Domain Controller (DC)** as the server that runs the Active Directory services (AD DS).

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain in an Enterprise are:

- **Centralised identity management:**Â All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.
- **Managing security policies:**Â You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.


Approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000 companies use Active Directory (AD).  Since AD is used for Identity and Access Management of the entire organisation, it is a critical component in the organisations's infrastructure, making it a very likely target for attackers. Deep understanding of the AD infrastructure and various red team engagements is important for a cybersecurity professional who wants to get better in defending the AD ecosystem.
