captured in different posts that will follow this one.
# Task 1:
An brief explanation that gave me a broad understanding of Microsoft's Active Directory is and why it is important.
It :
is the backbone of the corporate world. 
is a directory service used by organizations to manage users, computers, permissions, and security settings in a centralized way.
simplifies the management of devices and users within a corporate environment.

Think of it like the "brain" of an organization's IT environment.
It is used for:
Allowing employees to log into computers
Enforcing security policies
Managing thousands of users easily
Giving access to apps like Outlook, Teams, SharePoint
Protecting network resources

Task 2:
Indeed, for a corporate with many employees with each with a work computer, it would be difficult to manage each computer as a separate entity, manually configure policies for each of the users across the network and provide on-site support for everyone.
The computers and users are organized into a group called a Windows domain which is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given organisation. The administration of this group is centralised in a single repository known as an Active Directory (AD) and controlled by a server called a Domain Controller (DC).
The Domain Controller, a server running the Active Directory.
 It handles, Login authentication, Security checks and Updating of the AD database.
Components on an Active Directory

3. Users and Groups
Users = individual accounts
Groups = collection of users (simplifies permissions)

4. Organizational Units (OUs)
Folders in AD used to organize users, computers, and policies.
5. Group Policy (GPO)
Rules that control what users and computers can do, such as:
Password requirements
Blocking USB devices
Installing software automatically

```code
In a Windows domain, credentials are stored in a centralised repository called:
Active Directory

The server in charge of running the Active Directory services is called:
Domain Controller
